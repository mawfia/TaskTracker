# Todo Tracker
Individual Project created 22 December 2016

INTRODUCTION:
--------------------
This will be a Single Page AngularJS 1.5/JavaScript/jQuery/Spring/REST CRUD project application.  Currently the front-end logic with AngularJS/JavaScript/Jquery has been designed, built, and deployed to cloud services over a period of 2 days.

HOW TO USE:
---------------------
This is a basic task orginzer/tracker. The buttons are user friendly and fairly self-explanatory i.e. the "add todo" button adds tasks with the text the user inputs.  Tasks can be deleted, updated, and checked as completed.  A counter at the top keeps track of remaining tasks and a counter at the bottom of the application keeps track of tacks that are complete.  The use can show all tacks including completed tasks by clicking the "show completed tasks" checkbox.


NOTE TO USER:
---------------------
This is an ongoing project designed to teach Skill Distillery students new to AngularJS 1.5.  There is currently no back-end logic implemented i.e. no persistence of data via MySQL and JPA.  This will be implemented in 2017 once class resumes.  If time allows I will also implement UI BootStrap in this application for a more seamless execution with its native framework AngularJS.

TECHNOLOGY USED:
-----------------
1.  Front-end logic and data storage was executed using JavaScript, jQuery, and AngularJS 1.5.

2.  Bootstrap was used for front-end design and operations such as regular expressions for exception prevention and dynamically populated fields and drop-down lists were implemented using HTML5 and CSS3 and AngularJS 1.5.

6.  Apache Tomcat is used as the server for execution and JavaScript handles server/client requests.

7.  Spring/REST will be the framework used for dynamic management of objects with Spring Entity Manager and the Hibernate dependency.

8.  The application is deployed on a AWS account for cloud services.
